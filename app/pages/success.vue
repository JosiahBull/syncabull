    <!-- SO, the thinking: when we get to this page the user has been assigned an OTC which they can use for AN action -->
    <!-- so, this page will have a big success prompt, and then several buttons underneath -->
    <!-- [DELETE ACCOUNT]     [GET ACCESS TOKEN] -->
    <!-- With a small prompt underneath explaining (note that your browser login is *not* persistent, and you have 1 minute to choose an action before your token expires) -->

    <!-- We will then redirect the user back to the homepage-->

    <!-- The idea is that they can copy the token -->
